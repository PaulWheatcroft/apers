                <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-timeline"></i><br>ABOUT US</h2>

                <p>With an expert legal mind working on your HR or management issue at an affordable price, APERS offers the best all-round solution for your business.</p>

                <p>Traditionally businesses have used HR for day-to-day support and relied upon legal expertise when things get tricky. APERS offers more than a standard HR/ management consultancy and saves you the expense of law firm support. APERS achieves this by drawing on the two decades of legal and management expertise of its founder, Adrian Poole. Adrian was previously a partner of a regional law firm, heading up its successful Employment team. He also advised clients on managerial, regulatory and HR issues.</p>

                <p>APERS proudly describes itself as an Employment Relations Specialist. It seamlessly bridges the gap between process-driven and often limited or insular HR, and expensive and at times overly-complicated legal support. This means you can get the joined up support you require from just one place. No more separate conversations with different individuals or wondering whether your approach works on a variety of levels.  Moreover, we can plug-in to your team of existing advisors or put you in touch with others to provide a truly holistic approach; maximising the opportunities for your business across a range of areas.</p>

                <p>The result is a service which is second to none but priced to suit all pockets.</p>

                <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-seedling"></i><br>THE APERS APPROACH</h2>

                <p>Whatever your HR and management requirements, we will tailor-make a solution for you. </p>
                
                <p>If on the other hand you would prefer something more "off the shelf", then look no further.</p>
                
                <p>Our overall approach aims to add value to your business by simplifying everything associated with those who you employ. The APERS approach also involves discussion around your own aspirations as a business owner; whether that be to create the next Amazon, retire early or sell your business and move on to other ventures. In doing so, we will come up with a strategy which is right for you as an individual and for your business. </p>
