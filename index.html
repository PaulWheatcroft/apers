                <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-timeline"></i><br>ABOUT US</h2>

                <p>With an expert legal mind working on your HR or management issue at an affordable price, APERS offers the best solutions for your business.</p>

                <p>Whilst proudly an HR and management consultancy (rather than a law firm or other provider of legal services), APERS draws on the legal and management experience of its founder, Adrian Poole, who has over 20 years of experience as an employment and regulatory solicitor. He was previously a partner of a regional law firm.</p>

                <p>APERS  bridges the gap between process-driven HR and expensive legal support to give you the service your business deserves. Moreover, we will plug-in to your team of existing advisors or put you in touch with others to provide a truly holistic approach.</p>

                <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-seedling"></i><br>THE APERS APPROACH</h2>

                <p>Whatever your HR and management requirements, we will tailor-make a solution for you. </p>
                
                <p>If on the other hand you would prefer something more "off the shelf", then look no further.</p>
                
                <p>Our overall approach aims to add value to your business by simplifying everything associated with those who you employ. The APERS approach also involves discussion around your own aspirations as a business owner; whether that be to create the next Amazon, retire early or sell your business and move on to other ventures. In doing so, we will come up with a strategy which is right for you as an individual and for your business. </p>

                <p>He has also been a trusted advisor to many of his clients at a senior management level. </p>
